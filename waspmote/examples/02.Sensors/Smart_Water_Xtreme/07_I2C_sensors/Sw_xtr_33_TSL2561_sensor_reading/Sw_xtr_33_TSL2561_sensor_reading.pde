/*
    ----------- [Sw_xtr_33] - TSL2561 sensor reading --------------------

    Explanation: Basic example that turns on, reads and turn off the
    sensor. Measured parameters are stored in the corresponding class
    variables and printed by the serial monitor.

    Measured parameters:
      - Luminosity (Luxes)
