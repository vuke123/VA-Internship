/*
 *  ------ [4-20mA_02] Current Loop Connection State --------
 *
 *  Explanation: This sketch shows how to use the most important
 *  features of the 4-20mA current loop board in Waspmote. This
 *  standard is used to transmit information of sensor over long
 *  distances. Waspmote uses analog inputs for reading the sensor
 *  values.
