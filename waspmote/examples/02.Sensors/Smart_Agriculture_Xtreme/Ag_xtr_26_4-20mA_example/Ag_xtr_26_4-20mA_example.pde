    ----------- [Ag_xtr_26] - 4-20 mA example --------------------

    Explanation: Basic example that turns on, reads and turns off the
    sensor. Measured parameters are stored in the corresponding class
    variables and printed by the serial monitor.

    Measured parameters:
      - sensor current

  SELECT THE RIGHT SOCKET FOR EACH SENSOR.

  Possible sockets for this sensor are:
  - XTR_SOCKET_B       _________
  - XTR_SOCKET_F      |---------|
                      | A  B  C |
                      |_D__E__F_|


  Example: a 5TM sensor on socket A will be
  [Sensor Class] [Sensor Name] [Selected socket]
  Decagon_5TM    mySensor      (XTR_SOCKET_A);

  Refer to the technical guide for information about possible combinations.
