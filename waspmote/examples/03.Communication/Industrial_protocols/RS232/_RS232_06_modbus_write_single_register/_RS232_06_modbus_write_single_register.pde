/*   
 *  ------ [RS-232_06] Modbus Write Single Register -------- 
 *   
 *  This sketch shows the use of the Modbus communication protocol over 
 *  RS-232 standard, and the use of the main functions of the library.
 *. Modbus allows for communication between many devices connected
 *  to the same network. There are many variants of Modbus protocols, 
 *  but Waspmote implements the RTU format. Modbus RTU is the most 
 *  common implementation available for Modbus. 
 *  
 *  This example shows the use of the function writeSingleRegiter(). 
 *  This function code is used to write a single holding register 
 *  in a remote device.
