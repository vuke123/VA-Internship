/*
 *  ------------------ [BLE_13] - Characteristic notification - Slave ----
 *  Explanation: This example shows how indicate processes works.
 *  The program first make itself discoverable and connectable, waiting 
 *  for incoming connections. Once connected, waits for indication 
 *  subscribing events and, when they are found, the subscribed attribute is 
 *  written five times to allow the master receive notification events.
 *  Then, it waits till the indication acknowledge event fro the written value.
 *  Finally, it keeps waiting events till the connection is over.
