/*
 *  ------------------ [BLE_09] - Encrypted connection --------
 *
 *  Explanation: this code set discoverable/connectable mode on Waspmote to 
 *  allow connections from other BLE devices. Then wait during 30 seconds for 
 *  incoming connections. If a connection is established, the connection is 
 * encrypted andthen Waspmote keeps connected till the master ends the connection.
