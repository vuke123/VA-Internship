/*
 *  ------------------ [BLE_11] - Characteristic notification - Slave ----
 *  Explanation: This example shows how notifying processes works.
 *  The program first make itself discoverable and connectable, waiting 
 *  for incoming connections. Once connected, waits for notification 
 *  subscribing events and, when they are found, the subscribed attribute is 
 *  written five times to allow the master receive notification events.
 *  Then, it keeps waiting events till the connection is over.
