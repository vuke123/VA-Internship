/*  
 *  ------ [900_05] - get RSSI from last received packet  -------- 
 *  
 *  Explanation: This program shows how to get RSSI value from the 
 *  last received packet. For this protocol, there is an API function which
 *  shows this information. Before running this example, make sure there 
 *  is another emitter sending packets to this XBee module in order to 
 *  receive information.
