/*  
 *  ------ [PWR_4] Getting Battery Level Example -------- 
 *  
 *  Explanation: This example shows how to get the remaining battery 
 *  level.
 *
 *  WARNING: This example is suitable for rechargeable batteries only. 
 *  Non-rechargeable batteries always show a plain discharge curve, 
 *  so it is not possible to know how much power is left.
