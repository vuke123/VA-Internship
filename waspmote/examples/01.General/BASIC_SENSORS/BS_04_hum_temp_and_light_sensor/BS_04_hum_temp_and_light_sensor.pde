 *  ------ [BS_04] Getting the value of temperature, humidity and light sensor -------- 
 *  
 *  Explanation: This example shows how to get the vale of humidity sensors
 *  Temperature sensor MCP9700A connected to ANALOG6 pin
 *  Light sensor (LDR) connected to ANALOG5 pin
 *  Humidity sensor (808H5V6) connected to ANALOG7 pin
